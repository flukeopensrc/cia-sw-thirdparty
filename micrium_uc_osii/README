This directory and its contents are a replacement for the default uC/OS
directory that normally resides within the quartus installation
directory.

After installing quartus on a system, delete the default uC/OS and
then copy this in its place. The location should be something like the
following:
<quartus install directory>/nios2eds/components/micrium_uc_osii/
